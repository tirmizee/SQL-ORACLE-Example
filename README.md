#### COUNT field 

    SELECT

        COUNT(sal) AS count_sal,
        COUNT(comm) AS count_comm
    FROM emp_salary;

#### COUNT field with GROUP BY

    SELECT

        COUNT(*) AS count_total,
        COUNT(sal) AS count_sal,
        COUNT(comm) AS count_comm
    FROM emp_salary

#### COUNT with OVER PARTITION BY

    SELECT

#### COUNT with Subquery

### LISTAGG 

    LISTAGG(Column [, Delimiter])WITHIN GROUP (Order by Col_name) [Over(Partition by Col_name)]

#### LISTAGG with simple

    SELECT 
        LISTAGG(ename, ',') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY ename) AS employees
    FROM emp_salary where deptno = 20

    SELECT 
        deptno, 
        LISTAGG(ename, ',') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY ename) AS employees
    FROM emp_salary
    GROUP BY deptno
    ORDER BY deptno;

### WITH 

An alternative to an inline view is to move the subquery out to the WITH clause. We can then reference this named query in the FROM clause of the main SELECT statement. This can be used to make a very complicated FROM clause look much simpler.

#### WITH with simple

    SELECT 
        e.employee_name, 
        d.department_name
    FROM employees e
    JOIN departments d ON d.department_id = e.department_id
    ORDER BY e.employee_name;

    SELECT 
        e.employee_name, 
        d.department_name
    FROM employees e, departments d
    WHERE d.department_id = e.department_id
    ORDER BY e.employee_name;

    SELECT 
        ed.employee_name, 
        ed.department_name
    FROM (
        SELECT 
            e.employee_name, 
            d.department_name
        FROM employees e, departments d
        WHERE d.department_id = e.department_id
    ) ed
    ORDER BY ed.employee_name;

    WITH emp_dept_join AS (
        SELECT 
            e.employee_name, 
            d.department_name
        FROM employees e, departments d
        WHERE d.department_id = e.department_id
    )
    SELECT 
        ed.employee_name, 
        ed.department_name
    FROM emp_dept_join ed
    ORDER BY ed.employee_name;

#### WITH with multiple

### TRUNC

The TRUNC (date) function is used to get the date with the time portion of the day truncated to a specific unit of measure. 

    TRUNC(date , [fmt])

#### TRUNC with simple

    SELECT 
        TRUNC(TO_DATE('02-MAR-15 15:35:32', 'DD-MON-YY HH24:MI:SS')),
        TRUNC(TO_DATE('02-MAR-15 15:35:32', 'DD-MON-YY HH24:MI:SS'), 'DD') ,
        TRUNC(TO_DATE('02-MAR-15 15:35:32', 'DD-MON-YY HH24:MI:SS'), 'MM') ,
        TRUNC(TO_DATE('02-MAR-15 15:35:32', 'DD-MON-YY HH24:MI:SS'), 'YEAR') 
    FROM DUAL;

### TRUNCATE 

    TRUNCATE TABLE schema_name.table_name
    [CASCADE]
    [[ PRESERVE | PURGE] MATERIALIZED VIEW LOG ]]
    [[ DROP | REUSE]] STORAGE ]

#### TRUNCATE with simple 

    TRUNCATE TABLE temp_employee;

### Top-N Queries

    CREATE TABLE rownum_order_test (
      val  NUMBER
    );

    INSERT ALL
      INTO rownum_order_test
      INTO rownum_order_test
    SELECT level
    FROM   dual
    CONNECT BY level <= 10;

#### Rownum with simple

    SELECT 
        val
    FROM rownum_order_test
    WHERE rownum <= 5

#### Rownum with ORDER BY

    SELECT
        val
    FROM (
        SELECT 
            val
        FROM rownum_order_test
        ORDER BY val
    ) WHERE rownum <= 5

#### Rownum with paging

    SELECT  username FROM (
        SELECT username, rownum AS rnum FROM (
            SELECT username
            FROM users
            ORDER BY username
        ) WHERE rownum < :v_start + :v_limit)
    WHERE rnum >= :v_start;

### CONCAT 

    CONCAT(string1,string2)
    
#### CONCAT with simple

    SELECT CONCAT('Hello','World') FROM DUAL;                --HelloWorld
    SELECT CONCAT('Hello',CONCAT('World','2020')) FROM DUAL; --HelloWorld2020

    SELECT 'Hello' || 'World' FROM DUAL;                     --HelloWorld
    SELECT 'Hello' || 'World' || '2020' FROM DUAL;           --HelloWorld2020

### DATEDIFF

    SELECT 
        ((SYSDATE+1) - SYSDATE) * 24 AS Hours
    FROM DUAL;

    SELECT 
        ((SYSDATE+1) - SYSDATE) * 24 * 60 AS Minutes
    FROM DUAL;

    SELECT 
        ((SYSDATE+1) - SYSDATE) * 24 * 60 * 60 AS Seconds
    FROM DUAL;

    SELECT 
        TRUNC(MONTHS_BETWEEN(SYSDATE,(SYSDATE-60))) AS Months
    FROM DUAL;

    SELECT 
        TRUNC(MONTHS_BETWEEN(SYSDATE,(SYSDATE-600))/12) AS Years,
        MOD(TRUNC(MONTHS_BETWEEN(SYSDATE,(SYSDATE-600))),12) AS Months,
        SYSDATE - ADD_MONTHS((SYSDATE-600),TRUNC(MONTHS_BETWEEN(SYSDATE,(SYSDATE-600)))) AS Days
     FROM DUAL;
